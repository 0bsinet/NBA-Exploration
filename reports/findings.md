### Graph 1 - Average Points by Season (1996 - 2022)
In the line graph, there is a upward trend in points as we get closer to the present season. This can be explained by certain 
factors in the way the game is played such as increased emphasis on taking three-pointers and an increased pace of playing. 

### Graph 2 - Height vs Points
In the bar graph, each height is cateogrized by 20-percentile intervals 
(i.e. the first bar represents all the players who fall in the range of the minimum height and the 20th percentile height, 
the second bar represents all the players who fall in the range of the 20th percentile height and 40th percentile height and so forth.)
The change in average points from all 5 graphs is quite minimum with the range being only about 1.13.

### Graph 3 - Draft Number vs Points
This clustered scatterplot displays the possible relations between a player's draft number and how much they average in points. 
Players with the highest points averaged are generally among the top fifteen draft picks in their draft class.
However, there are many outliers, where those who were picked in the second round (after the 30th pick) were very efficient scorers (20+ points averaged)
(e.g. Isaiah Thomas who was a 60th overall pick yet almost averaged 30 points in one season).
